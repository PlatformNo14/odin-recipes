        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 ½ cups milk</li>
            <li>3 egg yolks</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1 ½ cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons sugar</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>5 tablespoons melted butter</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large bowl, mix together milk, egg yolks, and vanilla extract.
                Stir in the flour, sugar, salt, and melted butter until well mixed.</li>
            <li>Heat a crepe pan (if you don't have one, any non-stick frying pan will do) until hot.
                Add butter or oil to the pan. Pour around 1/4 cup of batter into the pan and then tip the pan
                until the batter has spread to the edges. When bubbles form on the top, and the edges are dry,
                flip over and cook until lightly browned on the other side. Repeat with remaining batter.</li>
            <li>Fill the crepes with fillings of your choice.</li>
        </ol>
